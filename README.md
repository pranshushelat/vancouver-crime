# Vancouver Crime Data

For my proposed project while at The Data Incubator if admitted, I've decided to do an analysis of the crimes reported in **Vancouver, BC** to the **Vancouver Police Department (VPD)**.

I've been living in Vancouver for the past 2.5 years and it only seems fit that I choose a dataset related to this city. Vancouver is consistently ranked within the **Top 3** livable cities in the world, however, it still faces its challenges related to number of crimes.

The data was obtained from the [Open Data Catalouge](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm "Crime Data") by [VPD](http://vancouver.ca/police/ "Vancouver Police Department")
